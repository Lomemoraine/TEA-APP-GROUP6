                <p class="card-text" id="hiddenp">Among the tropical crops there is none that demands such precise requirement as tea does
                  if optimum yield is to be obtained. Tea requires a climate with specific limits of certain
                  attribute; a soil with special characters, a proper clearing and preparation of land prior to
                  planting. It is therefore of paramount importance that in selecting a site for tea, due
                  consideration should be given to climatic and soil requirements of the tea plant before a
                  decision is made on whether the area is suitable for tea. A point to remember is that tea once
                  planted, could last for for up to 100 years and beyond. Tea requires rainfall of 1200mm to
                  2200mm that is well distributed throughout the year and temperatures ranging from 13⁰C
                  to 30⁰C with optimum of 30⁰C. An altitude of 1500 to 2250 meters above sea level is ideal
                  for tea cultivation. Wind breaks reduce the speed of wind thereby decreasing loss of
                  moisture from soil by evaporation and from the plants by evapotranspiration. The effective
                  height of trees should be 10m tall and belts of trees should be 85m apart. Trees
                  recommended for windbreaks are Hakea saligna, Grevillea robusta using trees and tea
                  hedges can also be used to shelter the tea bushes. Tea does well in well in deep well‐drained
                  red volcanic (minimum of 2 metre or 6 feet deep) with soil pH range of 4‐5.6. Tea is soil
                  specific, and requires acid soil, humid environment and does not tolerate long droughts with
                  the best quality tea being produced at high altitudes that remain free from free from frost.
                  Crop Care should be taken during land preparation to remove all forest trees by ring barking
                  to avoid armillaria root rot disease.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Sleeved plants are ready for transplanting when roots have reached the bottom of sleeves
                  and also have at least 20cm (8 in) of top growth. At the time of transplanting, the cylinder of
                  soil in sleeves should not be dry. The plants must be handled careful to avoid cracking the
                  cylinder the cylinder of soil and perhaps the roots and they should be stacked carefully and
                  tightly on any vehicle taking them to the field. A number of containers can be carried on a
                  wheelbarrow. This avoids all unnecessary handling of the sleeves. The sleeves should be
                  protected from direct sunshine at all times until planting is completed to prevent damage
                  the roots. The holes should be 15cm to 20 cm deeper than the sleeves and double their
                  diameter, though the minimum should be 25. For standard 25cm long x 6.25cm diameter the
                  sleeves the holes will be 40cm x 25cm. Use 15gm Diammonium Phospate (DAP)/Triple super
                  phosphate per planting hole or 30gm of single super phosphate. Mix fertilizers thoroughly
                  with soil from planting holes.</p>

                <p class="card-text">When applying fertilizers,it is critical to consider the size of the plant and other critical factors.</p>
                <ul class="container float">
                  <li class="item float-item">Young Plants<br>
                   <p> Young tea is tea of any age from the time of transplanting to the time of pruning at the end
                    of its first cycle, after about three years’ plucking (total of five years). In these five years, the
                    plants need nutrients to maintain their health and extra fertilizer to encourage the
                    development of strong root and branch systems, which will support vigorous cropping at
                    maturity. The fertilizer should be a compound or mixture providing N, P, K and S in the
                    proportions 5:1:1:1, or more concentrated in P and K. Young tea must be kept clear of weeds
                    and other crops grown in the tea are provided with fertilizer additional to that applied to tea.
                    Any convenient nitrogenous fertilizer should be applied broadcast to the soil surface, so as
                    to provide nitrogen at the rate of 12kg/ha, immediately before mulch is first applied to a
                    field. This is to compensate for the temporary loss of nitrogen from the soil while the mulch
                    breaks down.</p>  </li>
                  <li class="item float-item">Mother Plants<br>
                   <p> These are tea bushes, which are used as regular sources of cuttings. Removal of nutrients
                    from mother bushes is at a much greater rate than from plucked tea. Bushes weakened by
                    lack of nutrients (or because of pests, diseases, hail, drought, cold) produce less cuttings,
                    which strike less easily and grow more slowly in the nursery than those from bushes
                    producing vigorous shoot growth after pruning. Mother bushes should be given twice as
                    much fertilizer, of the same kind, per year as applied to plucked bushes of the same age.
                    Apply the fertilizers in at least two doses each year. These can be made two or three months
                    after each pruning. When a few bushes are pruned each day fertilizer can be applied to each
                    bush immediately it is pruned. If it is anticipated that two or three months after pruning
                    there will be no rain, then the fertilizer should be applied immediately after pruning.</p> </li>
